# SIAUC API

**SIAUC** (_Sistema Integrado de Asistencia de la Universidad de Colima, Integrated Attendance System of the University of Colima_) is an API prototype developed as part of a school project to manage teacher attendance at the Universidad de Colima (UDC). It operates alongside an ESP32 embedded system, which reads a teacher's unique identifier (UID) from their credentials and transmits it to the API. The API processes this information to track entry and exit times and manage the attendance status of teachers.
